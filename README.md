# FFTLog-and-beyond

An extended FFTLog code for efficiently computing integrals containing:

* one Bessel function (i.e. Hankel transform); or

* one spherical Bessel function; or

* one 1st or 2nd-derivative of spherical Bessel function.

The code is *independently* written and tested in python ([./python/fftlog.py](python/fftlog.py)) and C ([./cfftlog/](cfftlog)).

See more details in [Notes.pdf](Notes.pdf)
