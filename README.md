FFTLog-and-beyond

An extended FFTLog code for efficiently computing integrals containing:

(1) one Bessel function (i.e. Hankel transform); or

(2) one spherical Bessel function; or

(3) one 1st or 2nd-derivative of spherical Bessel function.

The code is *independently* written and tested in python (./python/fftlog.py) and C (./cfftlog/).

See more details in Notes.pdf

Please feel free to use and adapt the code for your own purpose, and let me know if you are confused or find a bug (just open an issue).
If you find the algorithm or the code useful to your research, please cite Fang et al (2019).
