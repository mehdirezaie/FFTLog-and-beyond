FFTLog-and-beyond

An extended FFTLog code for efficiently computing integrals containing:
(1) one Bessel function (i.e. Hankel transform); or
(2) one spherical Bessel function; or
(3) one 1st or 2nd-derivative of spherical Bessel function.

The code is *independently* written and tested in python (./python/fftlog.py) and C (./cfftlog/).
